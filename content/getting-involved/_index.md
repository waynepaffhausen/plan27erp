Thank you for your interest in helping to preserve the integrity of East Roswell Park and its surrounding neighborhoods!  We rely on volunteers like you to help us gather information, voice our concerns to the city, and spread the word to neighbors and park users.

## Attend public meetings
The [next public meeting is scheduled for Feb. 13 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.](https://www.appenmedia.com/alpharetta_roswell/roswell-city-officials-lay-out-2026-priorities/article_8e4f487c-4dd6-45e0-acaf-b5a89f37d14e.html) at [Roswell River Landing, 245 Azalea Drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H9bzb6X21brgcsGs5).  Even if you are only able to attend a small portion of the meeting, it helps to show the city that there are many residents opposed to building the fire station in East Roswell Park.
