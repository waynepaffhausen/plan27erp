## Our Mission
PLAN-27ERP exists to unite residents in opposition to the proposed relocation of Fire Station #27 inside East Roswell Park.  We believe that public park land serves as a vital function in our community and should remain dedicated to recreational use, green space preservation and enjoyment for all residents and visitors.  The conversion of park land for municipal facilities sets a concerning precedent and diminishes the quality of life in our local neighborhoods.

## Purpose & Objectives
By joining this group, you acknowledge and support our core objectives:
- To oppose the use of East Roswell Park land for Fire Station #27 relocation
- To advocate for alternative sites that do not compromise existing park resources
- To organize community awareness and engagement efforts
- To coordinate effective communication with local officials and decision makers
- To preserve our local neighborhoods character and property values

## Code of Conduct
To maintain a productive and respectful environment, all members must adhere to the following guidelines:
- **Unified Purpose:** All communications and activities must align with our mission to protect East Roswell Park from Fire Station #27 development.
- **Respectful Discourse:** Treat all members with courtesy and professionalism, even when opinions differ on strategy or tactics.
- **No Conflicting Content:** Members may not produce, share, or promote content that contradicts our mission or supports the Fire Station #27 relocation to the park.
- **Zero Tolerance for Harassment:** Any form of harassment, personal attacks, or abusive behavior toward other members will result in immediate removal from the group.
- **Confidentiality:** Respect the privacy of fellow members and exercise discretion when sharing group discussions externally.

## Removal Policy
Members who violate this charter through unsupportive actions, distribution of conflicting content, harassment of other members, or general disruptive behavior will be removed from the group without prior warning.

## Moving Forward Together
Our strength lies in our unity and commitment to this cause.  Together, we can make our voices heard and protect the green spaces that make our community special.
