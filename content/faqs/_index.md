## Why does the fire station need to be relocated?
In 2022, the City of Roswell (in conjunction with the Center for Public Safety Management, LLC) conducted a [gap analysis](https://www.roswellgov.com/wp-content/uploads/Roswell-Fire-Department-Strategic-Plan-20222027.pdf) of the Roswell Fire Department (RFD) and found that the RFD's travel times exceed modern standards.  The NFPA 1710 standard is a travel time under 4 minutes, 90% of the time.  However, [RFD's analysis](https://youtu.be/6mamySxSVWU?t=1013) of Fire Station 27 showed travel times of 6 minutes and 56 seconds, 90% of the time.

In 2024, RFD [conducted a Fire Response analysis](https://youtu.be/1dhoO87rVdg?t=13692) simulating travel time improvements after relocating Fire Station 27 and implementing a [traffic preemption system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal_preemption).  The simulations estimate that together, these changes could reduce travel times to 4 minutes and 48 seconds, 90% of the time.

In general, the [current location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J9HgRkn8hKKtE68a6) of Fire Station 27 is very near both the city and county lines.  Relocating the fire station further west should reduce the travel time from the station to many Roswell addresses.

## How was East Roswell Park selected?

The 2022 [gap analysis](https://www.roswellgov.com/wp-content/uploads/Roswell-Fire-Department-Strategic-Plan-20222027.pdf) recommended that Fire Station 27 be moved to the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Steeple Chase Drive to lower travel times.

In 2023, Jacobs Engineering was hired by the City of Roswell to perform a [site assessment](https://i.postimg.cc/x860w2TH/2026-01-22-leadership-conference-fire-station-update.png) of 3 potential locations near the original recommendation.  East Roswell Park was one of these locations, and all 3 assessed locations were near the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Fouts Road.  The assessment used criteria such as accessibility and roadways to determine the best choice.  The assessment preferred 2 sites that were south of Holcomb Bridge Road due to the fact that making a right-turn onto Holcomb Bridge Road would be favorable for response times.  The assessment had a slight preference for "Site 2": the site that was NOT East Roswell Park.  However, the city cited land acquisition costs and less-favorable topography as reasons to choose East Roswell Park instead.

The 2024 Fire Response analysis used an optimization model to find a new location for Fire Station 27 that would best improve response times.  [The model also recommended the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Steeple Chase Drive](https://youtu.be/1dhoO87rVdg?t=14604), which the city interpreted as confirmation of the East Roswell Park site selection.

## What other sites were evaluated?

The 2023 Jacobs Engineering [site assessment](https://i.postimg.cc/x860w2TH/2026-01-22-leadership-conference-fire-station-update.png) evaluated 3 potential locations for relocating Fire Station 27:
- "Site 1" - [2350 Holcomb Bridge Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2350+Holcomb+Bridge+Rd,+Roswell,+GA+30076/@34.0036361,-84.2929164,18.92z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f50ac0c907c41f:0x92f03a5a953831c4!8m2!3d34.0038905!4d-84.2925151!16s%2Fg%2F11bw3_17tx), the site of the former Rite Aid
- "Site 2" - [9140 Fouts Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/9140+Fouts+Rd,+Roswell,+GA+30076/@34.0036361,-84.2929164,18.92z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f50ac0e523c88f:0x4dd3f73247968776!8m2!3d34.0024194!4d-84.293185!16s%2Fg%2F11c2dd681c), the site of Iglesia Pentecostés Church
- "Site 3" - East Roswell Park along Fouts Road, the current planned location

## Why is the new site substantially larger than the previous site?

## Have residents successfully fought major projects like this before?

## What stage is the project in?  Is it too late to stop it?

## What can I do to help?
