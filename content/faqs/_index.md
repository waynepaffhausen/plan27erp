Here is a list of frequently asked questions about the Fire Station 27 project.  The answers below are intended to be as factual as possible using information that has been sourced from city council meetings and other documents shared with the public.

## Why does the fire station need to be relocated?
In 2022, the City of Roswell (in conjunction with the Center for Public Safety Management, LLC) conducted a [gap analysis](https://www.roswellgov.com/wp-content/uploads/Roswell-Fire-Department-Strategic-Plan-20222027.pdf) of the Roswell Fire Department (RFD) and found that the RFD's travel times exceed modern standards.  The NFPA 1710 standard is a travel time under 4 minutes, 90% of the time.  However, [RFD's analysis](https://youtu.be/6mamySxSVWU?t=1013) of Fire Station 27 showed travel times of 6 minutes and 56 seconds, 90% of the time.

In 2024, RFD [conducted a Fire Response analysis](https://youtu.be/1dhoO87rVdg?t=13692) simulating travel time improvements after relocating Fire Station 27 and implementing a [traffic preemption system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal_preemption).  The simulations estimate that together, these changes could reduce travel times to 4 minutes and 48 seconds, 90% of the time.

In general, the [current location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J9HgRkn8hKKtE68a6) of Fire Station 27 is very near both the city and county lines.  Relocating the fire station further west should reduce the travel time from the station to many Roswell addresses.

## How was East Roswell Park selected?

The 2022 [gap analysis](https://www.roswellgov.com/wp-content/uploads/Roswell-Fire-Department-Strategic-Plan-20222027.pdf) recommended that Fire Station 27 be moved to the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Steeple Chase Drive to lower travel times.

In 2023, Jacobs Engineering was hired by the City of Roswell to perform a [site assessment](https://i.postimg.cc/x860w2TH/2026-01-22-leadership-conference-fire-station-update.png) of 3 potential locations near the original recommendation.  East Roswell Park was one of these locations, and all 3 assessed locations were near the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Fouts Road.  The assessment used criteria such as accessibility and roadways to determine the best choice.  The assessment preferred 2 sites that were south of Holcomb Bridge Road due to the fact that making a right-turn onto Holcomb Bridge Road would be favorable for response times.  The assessment had a slight preference for "Site 2": the site that was NOT East Roswell Park.  However, the city cited land acquisition costs and less-favorable topography as reasons to choose East Roswell Park instead.

The 2024 Fire Response analysis used an optimization model to find a new location for Fire Station 27 that would best improve response times.  [The model also recommended the intersection of Holcomb Bridge Road and Steeple Chase Drive](https://youtu.be/1dhoO87rVdg?t=14604), which the city interpreted as confirmation of the East Roswell Park site selection.

## What other sites were evaluated?

The 2023 Jacobs Engineering [site assessment](https://i.postimg.cc/x860w2TH/2026-01-22-leadership-conference-fire-station-update.png) evaluated 3 potential locations for relocating Fire Station 27:
- "Site 1" - [2350 Holcomb Bridge Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2350+Holcomb+Bridge+Rd,+Roswell,+GA+30076/@34.0036361,-84.2929164,18.92z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f50ac0c907c41f:0x92f03a5a953831c4!8m2!3d34.0038905!4d-84.2925151!16s%2Fg%2F11bw3_17tx), the site of the former Rite Aid
- "Site 2" - [9140 Fouts Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/9140+Fouts+Rd,+Roswell,+GA+30076/@34.0036361,-84.2929164,18.92z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88f50ac0e523c88f:0x4dd3f73247968776!8m2!3d34.0024194!4d-84.293185!16s%2Fg%2F11c2dd681c), the site of Iglesia Pentecostés Church
- "Site 3" - East Roswell Park along Fouts Road, the current planned location

## Have residents successfully fought major projects like this before?

Yes!  One similar example is [Fire Station 24](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiETH8f5kHQfuMHb7) when it was being relocated from the site that is now Roswell Firelabs.  The [2024 Fire Response analysis](https://youtu.be/1dhoO87rVdg?t=14601) showed its current location to be very close to the model's recommendation.  However, this was *not* the first choice spot for relocating this station at the time.

The city's original plan in 2013 was [to build the fire station in Big Creek Park](https://www.appenmedia.com/news/wanted-a-good-home-for-roswell-mulls-fire-station/article_a1d94f62-df32-541e-8f84-7b960cc36664.html), once again taking a chunk of popular and heavily used park space to build a new fire station.  There was considerable citizen opposition to that, and it was thanks to the persistent efforts of local residents and park users that the city changed their plans.  The current location for Fire Station 24 was privately owned at the time.  However, the city chose to purchase the parcel for $1,000,000 on 12/10/2014, and built the new fire station there instead.

## What stage is the project in?  Is it too late to stop it?

As of Feb 2026, the project is currently in the design phase.  In Dec 2024, a task order was awarded to Hussey Gay Bell for designing Fire Station 27 at the East Roswell Park site.  However, the design is still pending final approval from the Roswell Design Review Board.  Until the design is approved, no construction contracts can be awarded.

For this reason, we believe it is not too late for the city to choose an alternative site.

## Are there other examples in Roswell where a fire station is so close to someone's front door?

No.  The closest example is [Roswell Fire Station #6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZFZYJKaccF9xoqi7).  However, in that example the bays point parallel to Cox Road, not across the street towards the house.  Additionally, the house across from Fire Station #6 is set back much further.

On Fouts Road, the front doors of the townhomes are [less than 20 feet from the edge of the street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Cwp9yLHHr7P3EMmT9), and less than 50 feet away from the proposed location of the fire engine driveway.  The garage bays will also be pointed directly across Fouts Road, meaning that any lights from the fire station would shine directly into the front door and windows of the residences.

## Why is the new site substantially larger than the previous site?

What's happening with Fire Station 27?
The City of Roswell is planning to relocate Fire Station 27 from its 
previous location (link) to East Roswell Park.  The plan involves carving out
3-5 acres of heavily-used park land to construct the new site.  Park users,
disc golf players, and local residents are opposed to this plan, and we need
your help in demanding the city to find an alternative location.


What's the big deal?
Simply put -- this plan is a cost-cutting measure that takes away park land in
an effort to save money on another project.

The current plan damages the park amenities and nearby neighborhoods in the following ways:
- Cutting down 221 trees
- Displacing 3 disc golf holes in the most popular disc golf course in Georgia
- Creating a dangerous pedestrian crossing by intersecting the fire engine driveway
  with the perimeter walking trail
- Adding a large detention pond right alongside the perimeter walking trail
- Putting fire engines less than 50 feet from the front doors of local residents
