What's the big deal?
{{< /hextra/hero-section >}}

Simply put — this plan is a cost-cutting measure that takes away park land in an effort to save money on another project.  The current plan damages the park amenities and nearby neighborhoods in the following ways:

- Cutting down 221 trees
- Displacing 3 disc golf holes in the most popular disc golf course in Georgia
- Creating a dangerous pedestrian crossing by intersecting the fire engine driveway with the perimeter walking trail
- Adding a large detention pond right alongside the perimeter walking trail
- Putting fire engines less than 50 feet from the front doors of local residents
- Adding congestion on an already narrow/congested side street
- Potentially blocking the only entrance/exit for residents along Fouts Rd.
